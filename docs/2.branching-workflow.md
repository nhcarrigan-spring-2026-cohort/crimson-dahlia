# 🌿 Branching Workflow (How We Work Safely on a Team)

Since you **can’t push directly to the main branch**, you’ll work on your own branch instead.

Think of branches like this:

* `main` = the clean, safe, finished version
* your branch = your personal sandbox

You build in the sandbox first so you don’t break the main app for everyone.

# 🛠 Your Step‑By‑Step Workflow (Every New Task)

Follow this EXACT order.

---

## 1. Make sure you’re on main first

```
git checkout main
```

This switches you back to the main branch.

---

## 2. Get the newest code

```
git pull
```

This downloads the latest updates from GitHub.

Always do this before starting new work.

---

## 3. Create your own branch

```
git checkout -b your-name-feature
```

Examples:

```
git checkout -b alex-login-page
```

```
git checkout -b maria-navbar-fix
```

### What does this do?

* `-b` = create new branch
* switches you to it automatically

Now you’re working safely on your own copy.

---

## 4. Do your coding

Edit files, save, test with:

```
npm start
```

---

## 5. Save your changes (commit)

```
git add .
```

```
git commit -m "Add login form layout"
```

Think of commits like mini save points.

---

## 6. Upload your branch to GitHub

```
git push -u origin your-name-feature
```

The first time you push a branch, you use `-u`.

After that, you can just run:

```
git push
```

---

## 7. Create a Pull Request (PR)

Now go to GitHub:

* You’ll see a button: **Compare & Pull Request**
* Click it
* Add a short description
* Submit

This asks the team to review your work before merging.

# 🔁 Daily Branch Routine (Quick Version)

```
git checkout main
git pull
git checkout -b my-feature
# code stuff
git add .
git commit -m "message"
git push -u origin my-feature
```

---

# 🔎 Helpful Git Commands

## See your current branch

```
git branch
```

The one with `*` is your current branch.

## Switch branches

```
git checkout branch-name
```

## Delete a branch (after it’s merged)

```
git branch -d branch-name
```
