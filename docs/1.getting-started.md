# 🚀 Local Development Setup Guide

Welcome! This guide walks you step‑by‑step through setting up your computer so you can run our app locally.

---

# 🧠 Big Picture (What are we doing?)

This guide will teach you how to:

1. Install the tools
2. Clone the project from GitHub
3. Start the app
4. Make changes and save them

This guide is *very* in depth, so depending on how much experience you have you may be able to skip some steps, but it's important we are all on the same page.

# 🧰 Step 0 — Install Required Tools

You only do this once on your computer.

## 1. Install Node.js

👉 Go to: [https://nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org)

Download **LTS (Recommended)** and install it.

### Why?

Node lets your computer run JavaScript outside the browser. React needs this.

---

## 2. Install Git

👉 Go to: [https://git-scm.com/downloads](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

Install with default settings.

### Why?

Git lets us download and share code from GitHub.

---

## 3. Install a Code Editor

I recommend **VS Code**, most people use this.

👉 [https://code.visualstudio.com](https://code.visualstudio.com)

---

# 🖥 Step 1 — Open the Terminal (CLI)

The **terminal** is just a text-based way to talk to your computer.

### Windows

* Press Start
* Type: `cmd` or `PowerShell`

### Mac

* Press Cmd + Space
* Type: `Terminal`

### VS Code (alternatively)

Inside VS Code:

```
View → Terminal
```

---

# 🧪 Step 2 — Check Everything Installed Correctly

Type these commands one at a time:

```
node -v
```

```
npm -v
```

```
git --version
```

If you see numbers like `v18.16.0` — you're good!

If you get "not recognized" → something didn’t install. Ask for help.

---

# 📦 Step 3 — Download (Clone) the Project

## What does “clone” mean?

It just means **copy the project from GitHub onto your computer**.

---

## 1. Go to the folder where you want the project

Example:

```
cd crimson-dahlia-folder
```

`cd` means "change directory" (move to a folder).

I would make a new folder for this project to go in, you can **go to your desktop → right-click → name that folder whatever you would like**. In this case, crimson-dahlia-folder.

*Note: Having this in extra folders may feel a bit tedious at first but if you're newer to terminal, it adds extra security to make sure you dont accidentally bother (delete) other files on your computer.*

---

## 2. Clone the repo

On GitHub, click **Code → copy the URL**

Then run (AGAIN MAKE SURE YOU ARE INSIDE THE RIGHT DIRECTORY/FOLDER):

```
git clone https://github.com/nhcarrigan-spring-2026-cohort/crimson-dahlia.git
```

---

## 3. Move into the project folder

```
cd crimson-dahlia
```

Now you're inside the project!



---

# 📚 Step 4 — Frontend Setup (React)

Now, within the project, let's move to the frontend setup

```
cd frontend
```
## 1. Install the dependencies

Using Node Package Manager, Run:

```
npm install
```

### What is this doing?

It downloads all the libraries the app needs.

Think:

> "Install everything this project depends on"

This may take a few minutes. Totally normal.

## 2. Start the frontend developement server

You'll know that this works if you can run the following and see our progress thus far:

```
npm run dev
```

Your browser should open automatically to something like:

```
http://localhost:3000
```
If not, you can hold ctrl and click the link in your terminal!

🎉 If you see the app, YOU DID IT!
---

# 🛑 How to Stop the Server

Press:

```
Ctrl + C
```

Then press `y` if asked. 

---

# ▶️ Step 5 — Backend Setup (Flask)

If you've been following along exactly, you will need to backtrack a little bit to make your way into the backend folder.

Where you were just in `../crimson-dahlia/frontend`, you now need to be in `../crimson-dahlia/backend`.
The quickest way to do this is by going back one directory and then changing into the next, like this:

```
cd ..
cd backend
```

Just like the frontend, you will need to install the backend dependencies, but it will use different commands.

## 1. Check Python

    python --version
    pip --version

If not installed, download from: https://www.python.org/downloads/

### What is pip?
PIP is Python's package installer; it's like easy_install, and it is going to make our lives much easier when it comes to updating and changing our dependencies. 

---

## 2. Create a Virtual Environment

    python -m venv venv

Activate it:

### Windows

    venv\Scripts\activate

### Mac / Linux

    source venv/bin/activate

### Why? 
A virtual environment makes sure that the versions of all dependencies used in this app do not affect anything else that may be using the same resources globally. Even if you are working on one project, it is good practice to use a virtual environment when working with Flask.

----

## 3. Install Dependencies

    pip install -r requirements.txt

If you have any errors with imports or things you are using in the backend, try running this command first. It will update any resources you are currently using to match the code to date. Also, please update this file if you add any dependencies to the backend.
For those who are familiar with frontend: *This is the Python version of `npm install`*

---

## 4. Start Flask

    flask run

You should see:

    Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000
---
## Congrats! You're all set up! 

# 🔁 Full Stack Developer Workflow

As we go along coding, if you want to see the app in full this is how I would recommend seeing it: 

Terminal 1:

    cd backend
    venv\Scripts\activate
    flask run

Terminal 2:

    cd frontend
    npm run dev

You only create the virtual environment once.
However, you must activate it every time you open a new terminal session.

❗Remember, if you are having 'not found' errors, always make sure your dependencies are up to date: 

`npm install` for the frontend and `pip install -r requirements.txt` for the backend

# 🌿 Git Basics (Saving Your Work)

## Check what changed

```
git status
```

## Add files

```
git add . 
```
*This adds all changed and new files. If you see something unexpected, run git status to double-check.*

## Save (commit)

```
git commit -m "describe what you changed"
```

Commits should be relatively short but meaningful "bug fixes" and "new feature" don't tell us what changes you've made, but "fix(ui): navbar is now responsive when resizing the window" is clear and categorized

https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/ : refer to this file for reference of what to call your commits

## Upload to GitHub

```
git push origin <branch-name>
```

Make sure you push to your branch and not main! (replace `<branch-name>` with the name of your branch)

---

# 🆘 Common Problems + Fixes

## "npm not found"

Node isn’t installed → reinstall Node

## "port already in use"

Another app is running → stop it or restart computer

## "pip not found" 

Check Python install → update if necessary

---

# 💬 Helpful Tips

* Don’t be afraid of the terminal
* Errors are normal
* Copy + paste errors into Google 1st!
* Ask questions early

Everyone starts here. 🧡
