# 🚀 Local Development Setup Guide

Welcome! This guide walks you step‑by‑step through setting up your computer so you can run our app locally.

---

# 🧠 Big Picture (What are we doing?)

This guide will teach you how to:

1. Install the tools
2. Clone the project from GitHub
3. Start the app
4. Make changes and save them

This guide is *very* in depth, so depending on how much experience you have you may be able to skip some steps, but it's important we are all on the same page.

# 🧰 Step 0 — Install Required Tools

You only do this once on your computer.

## 1. Install Node.js

👉 Go to: [https://nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org)

Download **LTS (Recommended)** and install it.

### Why?

Node lets your computer run JavaScript outside the browser. React needs this.

---

## 2. Install Git

👉 Go to: [https://git-scm.com/downloads](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

Install with default settings.

### Why?

Git lets us download and share code from GitHub.

---

## 3. Install a Code Editor

I recommend **VS Code**, most people use this.

👉 [https://code.visualstudio.com](https://code.visualstudio.com)

---

# 🖥 Step 1 — Open the Terminal (CLI)

The **terminal** is just a text-based way to talk to your computer.

### Windows

* Press Start
* Type: `cmd` or `PowerShell`

### Mac

* Press Cmd + Space
* Type: `Terminal`

### VS Code (alternatively)

Inside VS Code:

```
View → Terminal
```

---

# 🧪 Step 2 — Check Everything Installed Correctly

Type these commands one at a time:

```
node -v
```

```
npm -v
```

```
git --version
```

If you see numbers like `v18.16.0` — you're good!

If you get "not recognized" → something didn’t install. Ask for help.

---

# 📦 Step 3 — Download (Clone) the Project

## What does “clone” mean?

It just means **copy the project from GitHub onto your computer**.

---

## 1. Go to the folder where you want the project

Example:

```
cd crimson-dahlia-folder
```

`cd` means "change directory" (move to a folder).

I would make a new folder for this project to go in, you can **go to your desktop → right-click → name that folder whatever you would like**. In this case, crimson-dahlia-folder.

*Note: Having this in extra folders may feel a bit tedious at first but if you're newer to terminal, it adds extra security to make sure you dont accidentally bother (delete) other files on your computer.*

---

## 2. Clone the repo

On GitHub, click **Code → copy the URL**

Then run (AGAIN MAKE SURE YOU ARE INSIDE THE RIGHT DIRECTORY/FOLDER):

```
git clone https://github.com/nhcarrigan-spring-2026-cohort/crimson-dahlia.git
```

---

## 3. Move into the project folder

```
cd crimson-dahlia
```

Now you're inside the project!



---

# 📚 Step 4 — Install Project Dependencies

>IMPORTANT: You need to do steps 4 & 5 twice to ensure both frontend and backend are set up on your computer, so before moving on cd into frontend with `cd frontend`.

Run:

```
npm install
```

### What is this doing?

It downloads all the libraries the app needs.

Think:

> "Install everything this project depends on"

This may take a few minutes. Totally normal.

---

# ▶️ Step 5 — Start the App

Run:

```
npm run dev
```

Your browser should open automatically to something like:

```
http://localhost:3000
```

🎉 If you see the app — YOU DID IT!

---

# 🛑 How to Stop the Server

Press:

```
Ctrl + C
```

Then press `y` if asked. 

---

# 🔁 REPEAT - Set up the backend to match

If the backend isnt set up yet (There is no backend folder next to the frontend folder), you can skip this step, we will come back to it later. Otherwise, cd to the backend with `cd backend` and repeat steps 4 and 5.

Then you may continue.




# 📝 Step 6 — Make Your First Change

1. Open the folder in VS Code
2. Find `README.md`
3. Add your name to the file
4. Save


---

# 🔄 Daily Workflow (What you’ll do every day)

After the first setup, you usually only need:

```
cd crimson-dahlia
npm run dev
```

That’s it.

---

# 🌿 Git Basics (Saving Your Work)

## Check what changed

```
git status
```

## Add files

```
git add . 
```
*this should only add files that you've changed, if it adds other files there is something wrong*

## Save (commit)

```
git commit -m "describe what you changed"
```

Commits should be relatively short but meaningful "bug fixes" and "new feature" don't tell us what changes you've made, but "fix(ui): navbar is now responsive when resizing the window" is clear and categorized

https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/ : refer to this file for reference of what to call your commits

## Upload to GitHub

```
git push origin <branch-name>
```

Make sure you push to your branch and not main! (replace `<branch-name>` with the name of your branch)

---

# 🆘 Common Problems + Fixes

## "npm not found"

Node isn’t installed → reinstall Node

## "port already in use"

Another app is running → stop it or restart computer

# 💬 Helpful Tips

* Don’t be afraid of the terminal
* Errors are normal
* Copy + paste errors into Google 1st!
* Ask questions early

Everyone starts here. 🧡
